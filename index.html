relation speaks about a male to female voice conversion program. The
program is made of a training part and a conversion parts, that are
explained in the Design paragraph. In the implementation I will
introduce some parameters to adjust the final output. In the experiment
section is exposed how to tune these parameters by empirical
experiments using test on the output quality. In the conclusion I will
demonstrate how the conversion quality could be considered satisfying
with the usage of this method.</span></p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Times New Roman">In
this document we will be discussing the issue of male to female voice
conversion. The aim is to convert a given male sentence in a new
sentence that seems like pronounced by a female.<br>The state of art in
this field works not only on frequencies modify. Actual techniques
focus also on manipulation of vocal apparatus. The aim is to synthesize
a female voice based on the physical characteristics of the speaker.<br>My
approach consists on a simple method based only on frequencies
modification. The technique consists in two parts: the first is the
learning part. Here the program tries to understand a function for
frequencies modify. The second part consists on the conversion. The
frequencies of a given male voice has been converted using the previous
understand function.<br>The results of this approach give low sound
quality voice conversion results, this is probably due to the simple
method use for frequencies change. Anyhow the final output of the first
part seems like we expect, also the final voice certainly moves in the
direction of a female sound.</font></p>

      Design</a></b></font></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Times New Roman">The project is divided in two parts. The idea behind these is a conversion driven by a learning.<br>In
the first part the program focuses on learning a conversion function
starting from two given files. These are the same sentence, said by a
man and by a woman. The idea is to find the most significant
frequencies for every window. Then a map has been made from male to
female frequencies. By interpolation is generated a polynomial function
from the previous points.<br>In the second part starting from the
learned function the frequencies of a new given file are changed. After
this conversion in the final output we obtain a new sentence that seems
like said by a woman.</font></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>
      <a name="Implementation">Implementation</a></b></font></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Times New Roman">In
the training two files are required. They are divided in windows of the
same dimension. The input files are supposed to be distort in time and
in alignment at most in order of millisecond in every position.<br>A
conversion from the time domain to the frequencies domain is then
applied to every windows. Then for every frame of the male sentence the
most important frequencies are extracted. This is done checking the
power of every frequency. The strongest N frequencies of the window are
took in account. Then these N frequencies are inserted in a table and
one by one they are associated with the first N frequencies of the
corresponding window in the female sentence. So in the table the most
important frequency of the male sentence is associated with the most
important frequency in the female sentence, the second with the second
and so on. When this process has been done for every window then a
regression algorithm is applied. From all the pairs is calculated a
polynomial. It is important to underline the chose of a polynomial with
a low degree. This choice was done because a high degree polynomial
could perform worst than a low degree polynomial. This is because it is
simple to fall in an overfitting problem using high degree polynomial.
After this process we have a polynomial. As I said at the beginning of
this chapter the sentences in the two audio files could be not
perfectly aligned or could have different time length. This means that
some pairs of equal letters, in the two audio files, could be or not be
in the same windows. To remove this problem all the training process is
repeated more than once, and every time a different window size is
choose. With this strategy two letters that are not in the same window,
the first time, can be in the same window with different window size.
This avoid in part the alignment problem and the problem of different
time length. At the end the polynomial is defined by doing the mean of
all the found values of the polynomial for different window size.<br>The
second part apply the polynomial at the frequencies of the target audio
file. It is also apply a filter for don't introduce frequencies that
are not in the range 20 Hz-20000 Hz.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Times New Roman">The
experiments conducted are initiated by generating pairs of files
aligned and with time length with difference at the order of
milliseconds, how requested in the previous chapter. This was done
using the program audacity.<br>In every experiment the modified
parameters are: the number of different window sizes used, the windows
size and the number of frequencies taken into account in every window.
The parameters are evaluated by listening the final audio file and
taking into account both audio quality and quality of the conversion.
The training have been run on spoken sentences. The optimal values
found for the parameters are:<br></font></p><ul><li><font face="Times New Roman">Number of different
sizes of window used: 5. The conversion quality is worse using higher
values. For this reason the number is small;</font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"></span>Window size: from 24 to 40 ms. Bigger windows sizes have been tried
but the quality of the final audio file go down very fast with higher
size;<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"></span>Frequencies for window taken into account: 8.
This number is completely empirical. Very low values for this number
work very bad, but increase this value more then 8 gives lower
conversion quality.<br></li></ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Times New Roman"><br>In general the polynomial, from the training
part, seems good. This because for every input frequency an higher
output frequency is returned. This seems correct because normally the
frequencies of a female voice are higher of the frequencies of a male
voice.<br>For conversion quality the results are not really good, but
the final result seems like a sort of female voice. Also the quality,
of final audio file, could be accept also if in the result is
introduced some noise. </font> </p>
